# # Rabbits and foxes
# 
# There are initially 400 rabbits and 200 foxes on a farm (but it could be two cell types in a 96 well plate or something, if you prefer bio-engineering analogies). Plot the concentration of foxes and rabbits as a function of time for a period of up to 600 days. The predator-prey relationships are given by the following set of coupled ordinary differential equations:
# 
# \begin{align}
# \frac{dR}{dt} &= k_1 R - k_2 R F \tag{1}\\
# \frac{dF}{dt} &= k_3 R F - k_4 F \tag{2}\\
# \end{align}
# 
# * Constant for growth of rabbits $k_1 = 0.015$ day<sup>-1</sup>
# * Constant for death of rabbits being eaten by foxes $k_2 = 0.00004$ day<sup>-1</sup> foxes<sup>-1</sup>
# * Constant for growth of foxes after eating rabbits $k_3 = 0.0004$ day<sup>-1</sup> rabbits<sup>-1</sup>
# * Constant for death of foxes $k_4 = 0.04$ day<sup>-1</sup>
# 
# *This problem is based on one from Chapter 1 of H. Scott Fogler's textbook "Essentials of Chemical Reaction Engineering".*

# # Now let's try some Kinetic Monte Carlo

# We wish to implement a Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the same situation. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_Monte_Carlo for details.
# 
# We'll assume the numbers of rabbits and foxes (starting at 400 and 200) are actual rabbits and foxes, not "rabbit densities" for example, and so must always remain integers: you can't have half a rabbit or half a fox.
# 
# There are four events, with rates that are straightforward to calculate, so the rejection-free algorithm is suitable:
# * `rabbit_birth = k1 * rabbits`
# * `rabbit_death = k2 * rabbits * foxes`
# * `fox_birth = k3 * rabbits * foxes`
# * `fox_death = k4 * foxes`
# 
# 
# Use a Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation(s) running for 600 days to determine
# 1. The expected location of the second peak in foxes (eg. 425 days, 2800 foxes), on occasions that there is one (eg. if there's a peak that's  >200 days and >100 foxes)
# 2. The interquartile range of the second peak in foxes (eg. 411-443 days, 2700-3120 foxes).
# 3. The probability that the foxes die out before 600 days are complete
# 
# Make sure you've done enough simulations to be suitably confident in your answers (given the precision you think appropriate).

# # Your turn!
